# ArBarCodeProject
 

**ArBarCodeProject** is a cutting-edge mobile application built with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) and Compose Multiplatform, designed to integrate Augmented Reality (AR) and Barcode scanning functionalities. This project aims to provide a seamless and robust solution for various use cases
involving barcode recognition and interactive AR experiences across both Android and iOS platforms from a single codebase.
 
## ‚ú® Features

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/888ce90d-522b-4a59-9f8f-ac2c262e67bb



* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, ensuring a native experience on both Android and iOS from a shared codebase.
* **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:** Explore interactive AR features, likely for overlaying digital information or experiences onto the real world.
* **Barcode Scanning:** Efficiently scan and process various barcode types (e.g., QR codes, UPCs) for data retrieval or product information.
* **Modern UI:** Utilizes Compose Multiplatform for a declarative, modern, and consistent user interface across all supported platforms.
* **Shared Business Logic:** Centralized business logic and data models for easier maintenance and development.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM):** For sharing code between Android and iOS.
* **Compose Multiplatform:** For building native UIs across Android and iOS.
* **Android Jetpack Compose:** For Android-specific UI components.
* **SwiftUI:** For iOS-specific entry points and potential platform-specific UI.
* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Android Studio (with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin)
* Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)
* JDK 11 or higher

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haidrrrry/ArBarCodeProject.git
cd ArBarCodeProject
```

2. **Open in Android Studio:** Open the `ArBarCodeProject` directory in Android Studio. Android Studio will automatically resolve the dependencies.

3. **Run on Android:**
   * Select the `androidApp` run configuration.
   * Choose an emulator or a connected Android device.
   * Click the 'Run' button (green triangle) in Android Studio.

4. **Run on iOS:**
   * Open the `ArBarCodeProject` directory in Android Studio.
   * Select the `iosApp` run configuration.
   * Choose an iOS simulator.
   * Click the 'Run' button (green triangle) in Android Studio. Android Studio will build and launch the app in Xcode.
   * Alternatively, you can open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` directly in Xcode and run from there.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile structure:

* **`/composeApp`**: This module contains the shared logic and UI code that is common across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
   * **`commonMain`**: Contains the core business logic, data models, and shared Compose Multiplatform UI components that are used by all targets (Android, iOS).
   * **`androidMain`**: Contains Android-specific implementations, dependencies, and the `MainActivity` for the Android application.
   * **`iosMain`**: Contains iOS-specific implementations, dependencies, and the entry point for the iOS application.
* **`/iosApp`**: This directory contains the Xcode project for the iOS application. Even when sharing UI with Compose Multiplatform, this is where the iOS application's entry point resides, and where you might add SwiftUI code for platform-specific needs.

## üì± Platform-Specific Features

### Android
- **ARCore Integration**: Utilizes Google's ARCore for augmented reality experiences
- **CameraX**: Advanced camera functionality for barcode scanning
- **ML Kit**: Google's machine learning kit for barcode detection and recognition
- **Material Design 3**: Modern Android design system implementation

### iOS
- **ARKit Integration**: Apple's augmented reality framework for immersive experiences
- **AVFoundation**: Core camera and media framework for scanning functionality
- **Vision Framework**: Apple's computer vision framework for barcode detection
- **SwiftUI**: Native iOS UI components where needed

## üéØ Use Cases

This application can be utilized in various scenarios:

* **Retail & E-commerce**: Product scanning for price comparison and information retrieval
* **Inventory Management**: Quick barcode scanning for stock tracking and management
* **Educational**: Interactive AR experiences combined with QR code learning materials
* **Marketing**: AR-enhanced promotional campaigns triggered by barcode scanning
* **Logistics**: Package tracking and warehouse management solutions

## üîß Configuration

### Camera Permissions

**Android** - Add to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="true" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
```

**iOS** - Add to `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to scan barcodes and provide AR experiences</string>
```

### AR Requirements

**Android** - ARCore metadata in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<meta-data android:name="com.google.ar.core" android:value="required" />
```

**iOS** - ARKit capability in `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses AR to enhance barcode scanning experience</string>
```
